Simple Flash Card Tool

All Flash Card tools suck. They are overloaded with crap that no-one needs, 
but fail to do the basic tasks properly. Thats why I made a flash card tool
that sucks in a way thats bearable for me. 
Most flash card tools are based on boxes: A correctly answered question moves
one box up. fc is not capable of this, but it uses roulette wheel selection 
to give questions, that were often answered wrong, a higher chance of being
picked.

fc takes a text file that has to have a certain structure, like this:

Q your question QEND
P correct_answers wrong_answers PEND

A
your answer
AEND

Set correct_answers and wrong_answers initially to 1 as I don't yet check for 
divisions by zero ;) Except for the answer block, no line breaks are allowed!
See the example file for details.

Run fc like this:

$ ./fc yourfile.txt

After quitting fc, all the questions in the file are ordered (best answered ones
at the end).

Make sure to backup your file before you use fc, because the file is overwritten
at the end. This could screw everything up!
